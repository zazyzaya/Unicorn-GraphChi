 * The array "tme" is corresponding timestamps. The first element is the timestamep of the edge.
 * The following elements are the corresponding timestamps of the relabeled node at each hop.
 * "dst" is the label of the destination node.
 * "itr" is the number of times the destination node has access the edge for computation.
 * "edg" is the edge label.
 * For streaming new edges:
 * 		- "new_src": whether the source node is a new node, never-before-seen.
 * 		- "new_dst": whether the destination node is a new node, never-before-seen.
